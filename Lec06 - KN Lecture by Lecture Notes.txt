Development of the model_trainer.py is needed 

In the similar fashion of developing the data_transformation and data_ingestion
a dataclass is used
class ModelTrainerConfig:

here the path for the pickle object to be saved is provided
    

This class is instantiated in the model_trainer.py
Model_trainer has the class ModelTrainer which comprises of training_array function which in turn 
uses the train and test data split to instantiate non-hyperparatemer trained multiple models 
(which are declared in the form of dictionary) and 
then evaluate those on the r2 score of the test data 

For evaluating, the utils file has been developed that comprises of the evaluate function. 
This function returns a dictionary of models and their test data r2_scores. 

In the model_trainer.py within the training_array function,
This is then used to select the model in the non-hyperparameter trained with the 
best scores and return the r2_score in printed format
