Create the notebook folder
In the subfolder create the data subfolder

Make sure to build the jupyter notebook to do the EDA

Add scikit-learn, catboost and xgboost in requirement.txt and run the command 
pip install -r requirements.txt

In this case, it seems the python script for EDA was written in older python, 
therefore we had to make quite a few modifications to the EDA code

Run the Notebook for EDA, make sure that there is a few modules on quantitative separation

Run the Model training notebook

Model_trainer.py will have the training part
Best model and train test split -- utils.py this will get called in the  data ingestion part
